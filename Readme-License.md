# What's this license?

This is the license text.

```
Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or to distribute the works is granted,
provided that all copyright notices appear unchanged in all copies. The works
are provided 'as is'. The authors disclaim any warranty whatsoever. In no
event whatsoever are they liable for any damage in any regard with the works.

This license text is influenced by the ISC license but is a lot conciser. It has
the same objectives as the ISC license. That's why I use «ISC+» as the SPDX
license identifier. Rationales for some modifications of the ISC  license follow
below.

The clause «for any purpose» in the ISC license text is superfluous. If you 
omit it and just say "permission is granted", then it is implicit that you grant
permission for any purpose.

The clause «with or without fee» is tautologic. Either you sell your software
(but then you can't disclaim as much because of imperative law, see below) or
you don't. Tertium non datur, i.e. there is no other way.

The verbose listing of situations where warranties and liabilities are
disclaimed looks intimidating, but is unneccessary. The small word «any»
suffices. It covers all imaginable and even future unthinkable occurrences
where something bad happened with the works. The risk seems to be lower, too.
I also lowercased this part. It is written in shouting case in the ISC license.

I replaced the word «software» with «works», because not all files in a
repository might be source code for software. This word also emphasizes the
artistic character of software.

I also kept in my mind that imperative law trumps licenses. One case is you
doing something illegal with your works. You can't assert the disclaimer in such
a case. Additionally if you sell software you are bound to some imperative laws
depending on your jurisdiction. Keeping this in mind it is even easier just to
use the word «any», because it just means anything applies except if some law is
stronger than your license.

I think this license reads a lot better than the original ISC license or the MIT
license. It is not as impressive and fear-inducing but so what.
